# Tic Tac Toe

A two player came where users anywhere can play against each other. 
When you enter the app, you will be automatically put in a game room. 
If you are the first to arrive, you will have to wait for another 
to join. The game will start when the second player arrives. You can 
test the game by opening two browser windows. 

The live app can be viewed here: https://alberta-tictactoe.herokuapp.com
